To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

-we don't even care about the exact number generated by the PRNG, 
-since our objective is to just mimic the mechanism through which any number is generated.

1.Understand the purpose of the contract
2.Study the contract's data flow (i.e the order in which functions are called)
3.discard operations that seem trivial and non-vulnerable
4.focus on strange, not-so-common implementations of operations 
(function calls, weird usage data types, custom functions)
5.it is a CTF challenge, it MUST have a solution
